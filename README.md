# External Services Demo
This is an example of the Salesforce External Services (Beta) feature.  External Services provides you a mechanism to connect to a service of your choice, invoke methods based on that external source via flow and interact with the data from that service. This is all done with an easy-to-use wizard, no apex required.  An External Service must have a schema defined in either interagent or Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 formats for it work with the wizard.

## Post Install Step
After pushing this code to your org, ensure that the flow is active and that the permission set is assigned to the user. If these items are not completed, the flow will not run properly.
